# StudySync 📚

**StudySync** is a comprehensive student dashboard application that makes it super easy to sync different courses, assignments, and exams into a single unified portal by simply uploading PDF syllabi. Unlike traditional LMS platforms like Canvas and Blackboard that often fail to provide centralized course management (because professors don't maintain them properly), StudySync automatically extracts and organizes all your academic information from syllabus PDFs using AI.

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered PDF Analysis**: Upload syllabus PDFs and automatically extract course information, schedules, assignments, and grade distributions
- **📊 Unified Dashboard**: View all your courses, upcoming deadlines, and class schedules in one place
- **📈 Grade Tracking**: Input your marks and get calculated grades based on course distribution
- **📅 Smart Scheduling**: Navigate through your daily class schedules with an intuitive interface
- **💬 AI Assistant**: Chat with an intelligent assistant for study tips, scheduling help, and academic guidance
- **🔄 Real-time Sync**: Automatically sync course data with Firebase for persistence across devices

## 🏗️ Architecture

StudySync is built as a full-stack application with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask Python API with Google Vertex AI integration
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for user data persistence
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for PDF analysis and chat functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher)
- **Google Cloud Account** with Vertex AI API enabled
- **Firebase Project** for data storage

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
   ```env
   # Google Cloud Configuration
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
   
   # Firebase Configuration (JSON string)
   FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
   
   # Optional: Custom port
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Set up Google Cloud credentials**:
   - Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Vertex AI API
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth login
     gcloud config set project your-project-id
     ```
   - Or set up service account credentials in your environment

5. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Generate a service account key (JSON)
   - Add the JSON content to your `.env` file as `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS`

6. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:
   ```env
   # API Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   
   # OpenAI Configuration (for chat functionality)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
